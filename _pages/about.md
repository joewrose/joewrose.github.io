Hi! I'm Joe. I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Glasgow. I'm currently the president of the Cyber-Security Society ([GUSEC](https://gusecurity.github.io/)) and I've got an interest for all things low-level and security.

I'm currently completing my final year project focussing on _The effect and mitigation of ELF file manipulation on software defined networks_. Completing this project has lead me down some fascinating rabbit-holes so far into the details of the runtime linker and how ELF files can be manipulated out of spec to create interesting and novel effects.

I'm also a software engineer at the Glasgow University Software Service ([GUSS](https://guss.org.uk/)). Where I'm currently working on a web-app for an external client, [Vectofy](https://vectofy.co.uk/).
